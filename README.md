## Suggestions

To maximize your learning from past competitions, follow this comprehensive approach for each competition you study:

### Understanding the Competition

- **Competition Description**: Understand the business problem and objectives
- **Evaluation Metric**: Study how solutions are scored (AUC, RMSE, Log Loss, etc.)
- **Dataset Characteristics**: Analyze data types, size, features, and any special considerations
- **Timeline & Rules**: Review competition duration and specific constraints

### Learning from Top Performers

- **Leaderboard Analysis**: Check profiles of top finishers to understand their approach patterns
- **Solution Discussions**: Read post-competition solution threads (often titled "1st place solution", "Our approach", etc.)
- **Code Notebooks**: Study the most upvoted and awarded kernels for implementation details
- **Ensemble Strategies**: Note how winners combined multiple models

### Key Areas to Focus On

- **Feature Engineering**: What creative features did winners develop?
- **Model Selection**: Which algorithms performed best and why?
- **Validation Strategy**: How did top performers set up cross-validation?
- **Post-Processing**: What techniques were applied to final predictions?

### Applying Knowledge

- Try implementing winning solutions on your own
- Experiment with variations and test your understanding
- Document your learnings and insights in your forked repository
